#Miscellaneous Scripts

These are just some random scripts that I've written and find useful. Use them at your own risks; many of them are made without full error checking and might kill your cat. I'm not responsible for Fluffy.

All of these scripts are released without a license, so use and redistribute them as you see fit.

-`lch.sh`: Launches a program silently in the background
-`mountvms.sh`: Automates mounting shared volumes in VMWare with open-vm-tools
-`ramdisk.sh`: simple ramdisk creater and manager
